Built this project with HTML, CSS, and JS. No libraries. Did not have access to design specs. 

Built this with mobile first philosophy.

The struggle for me was not so mush the JS but the styling. Dealing with widths and positioning had me struggling. Understanding how width, height, max-width, min-width, etc... works when the viewport changes had me at a long pause in order to make this a resposive design. 

I used 900px as the breaking point beause the mobile layout seemed to display well up to that point. 

I enjoye the challenge of how to use position ino order to display the desktop images. It was a good learning experience in developing a way to layer each position.

All criticism welcomed. thank you.
